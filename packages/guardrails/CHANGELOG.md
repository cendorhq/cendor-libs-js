# @cendor/guardrails

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 81ce71b: Add `scoped(guardrails, fn)` (per-async-context gating via AsyncLocalStorage, all-runtime with a single-context fallback), per-guardrail `timeout` + `onError` execution policy on `rules.custom` / `rules.llmJudge` / `defineGuardrail` (async-path timeout, fail-closed/fail-open recorded as evidence), and LLM-judge helpers (`judge.verdictPrompt` / `parseVerdict` / `judge`) for composing a bring-your-own model judge into a `rules.llmJudge` check.

  Also add opt-in **detection-tier adapters** (`adapters.*`, re-exported as `rules.*`): `classifier` (a generic, license-agnostic contract around any local classifier — bool/score/`{label:score}`, threshold + `label`), `language` (trip when the detected language is not in `allowed`, via a bring-your-own `detect`), and `openaiModeration` (trip when OpenAI's free moderation endpoint flags the payload — BYO client, optional category filter). No ML/network deps of the package; no jailbreak-detection claim. `prompt_guard` stays Python-only (needs `transformers`) — in TS wire an ONNX/transformers.js model through `rules.classifier`.

- 4d26329: Wave 3 — hosted rails, config-as-data, and grounding (additive; TS mirror of `cendor-guardrails` 1.2.0):

  - **Hosted-rail adapters** (`rules.bedrockGuardrail` / `azureContentSafety` / `modelArmor`, also on `adapters.*`): duck-typed cloud clients (no AWS/Azure/Google SDK imported here), metered by the vendor, but every verdict emits a **local** `GuardrailDecision` on the bus — "cloud check, local evidence". These are async (the JS cloud SDKs are async), so use them via the SDK loop / `applyAsync`, not the sync `install()` seam.
  - **Config-as-data** — `loadPolicy(source, { parse })` builds deterministic rules from a versioned JSON/YAML document. The result is a `Guardrail[]` (`LoadedPolicy`) that also carries `policyHash` (a bundled, dependency-free, all-runtime SHA-256) and `policyVersion`; both are stamped into every decision's `metadata` so the audit chain proves which policy was active. JSON is built in; pass `parse` (e.g. a YAML parser) for YAML — there is no `node:fs`, so read the file yourself and pass the text/object.
  - **Grounding & denied topics** — `rules.groundedness(embed, sources)` / `rules.deniedTopics(embed, topics)` gate on cosine similarity over a bring-your-own `embed(text)` fn (cassette's BYO-scorer precedent). No bundled model, no accuracy claim.
  - **`Guardrail.metadata`** (also `defineGuardrail({ metadata })`) — static per-guardrail metadata merged into every decision it emits, under the per-call `Context.metadata` (which wins a clash).
  - **Red-team evaluation** (`runRedteam` / `runRedteamAsync` / `loadCorpus` / `RedTeamReport`) — measure trip rate + false-positive rate + a per-category breakdown against a labeled corpus **you** supply (no vended data; `loadCorpus` takes a parsed array or jsonl/json/csv text — no `node:fs`).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7679740: First release of `@cendor/guardrails` — the **Gate** in the Cendor pipeline (`contextkit → squeeze → tokenguard → guardrails → cassette → acttrace`). The TypeScript port of `cendor.guardrails`.

  Define a deterministic check — `keywordDeny`, `regexRule`, `urlAllowlist` / `urlDeny`, `lengthBounds` (char + exact token bounds via `@cendor/core`), `jsonSchema`, `custom` — and attach it to one of four intervention points (`input` / `tool_call` / `tool_output` / `output`). A `Verdict` trips with `block` (fail-closed → `GuardrailTripped`), `redact` (replace the payload and continue), or `flag` (record and continue). Three ways to use it: pure `apply()` / `evaluate()` (+ async), framework-independent `install()` (one `@cendor/core` interceptor + an output subscriber), and — via `@cendor/sdk` — `Agent({ guardrails: [...] })`.

  Every trip or flag emits a `GuardrailDecision` on the `@cendor/core` bus, so `@cendor/acttrace` chains it as a tamper-evident `guardrail_decision` entry with **no import** in either direction (duck-typed). Regex/arithmetic only — microseconds, offline, `$0`, no `node:*` (all-runtime). `llmJudge` is a bring-your-own model-judge adapter contract, not a bundled classifier. Deterministic checks do not stop a novel adversarial attack — see the docs' "Honest limits".
