acttrace: `AuditLog(path)` no longer truncates an existing log on construction. It now opens the file in append mode and resumes the hash chain from the last on-disk entry instead of restarting from genesis and overwriting prior entries — a silent data-loss bug that broke long-term retention. A reopen is a pure resume (no new `audit_open` marker, existing entries preserved, `verify()` spans the full chain); a fresh log is unchanged; a corrupt/unparseable tail throws instead of silently restarting. `export()` still truncates as before.

core: eagerly warm the default `o200k_base` token encoder at module import so the first guarded pre-flight (or first `tokens.count`) in a process no longer pays the one-time js-tiktoken encoder build. Pure optimization — the warm-up is once-guarded and never throws.
